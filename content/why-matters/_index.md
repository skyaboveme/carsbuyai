## The Consequences of AI Invisibility

When AI platforms don't know about your dealership:

- **Lost Sales**: Customers find your competitors instead
- **Reduced Visibility**: You're invisible to AI-powered research
- **Lower Trust**: AI recommendations carry more weight than ads
- **Missed Opportunities**: You can't compete in AI-driven conversations
